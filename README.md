# Hi there, I'm Mansi Patel! üëã

As a seasoned full-stack developer and a fervent enthusiast in web APIs, SQL Server, and Python, I've recently ventured into the dynamic world of data science. My passion for machine learning and data analysis drives me to continuously explore new technologies and methodologies that can transform raw data into meaningful insights. Here's a deeper look into my journey and the technologies I'm currently exploring:

## üöÄ About Me
- üî≠ **Currently Studying:** Masters of Business Analytics at Schulich School of Business, Toronto, Canada.
- üå± **Learning:** Advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques to predict and understand user behaviors and preferences.
- üí° **Interested In:** Harnessing the power of data science to solve complex problems and make data-driven decisions in both professional and personal projects.
- Feel free to connect with me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mansi-patel-061099/) for more updates on my projects and learning journey.

## üåü Research
- **Deep Learning Based Multimedia Forgery Detection System:** View my research paper on IEEE Xplore, titled "Multimedia Forgery Detection System." This work explores innovative techniques for detecting forgeries in multimedia content, contributing to the integrity and trustworthiness of digital media.
